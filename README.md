# Pandemic Monument

Hello, this project aggregates multiple sources of data related to the pandemic in Malaysia. I have uploaded a dashboard here: https://www.nopynospy.cc/pandemic_monument

1. Daily cases (https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public)
2. Daily news headlines (collected using a Chrome extension that I am still developing)
3. Foreign exchange rate (https://www.investing.com/currencies/myr-usd-historical-data)
4. Prime Minister terms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia)

I will try to update this repo daily. The data are saved in:

1. Daily cases (daily.csv)
2. Daily news headlines (imputed_fmt{date}.csv)
3. Foreign exchange rate (myr_usd.csv)
4. Prime Minister terms (pm_term.csv)
